QSARBoost is a flexible Python framework for building, validating, and applying gradient boosting–based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models.

✨ Features
Data Curation – Import, clean, and preprocess chemical datasets from ChEMBL or other sources.

Molecular Featurization – Generate ECFP4 fingerprints or other descriptors using RDKit.

Gradient Boosting Models – Support for multiple boosting algorithms: CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, GradientBoostingRegressor.

Model Selection & Optimization – Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna.

Applicability Domain (AD) – Williams plot & Mahalanobis distance methods for prediction confidence.

Virtual Screening – Apply trained models to large chemical libraries (e.g., DrugBank).
